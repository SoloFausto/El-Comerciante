# El-Comerciante
Final high school project in which we were tasked to create a fully featured app for restaurants. We worked with a local ice cream shop called Dolcezza to create an app following their requirements.
This project is currently **incomplete** and it isn't in a state of current development. 
If any of the original developers want to continue the development we'll fork it. 
The current version is what we presented to the professors. Our group is comprised of 4 people who covered various areas of the project.
We were also tasked with creating a document that explained all the parts of the work that we created. 

# About using this project or parts of it.
I honestly don't know why would you want that. If you really desire to fork it, please contact me (SoloFausto) to the email that's in my profile so we can discuss it further.
